Revision of Inguz Plugin Web and Perl components

Inguz DSP engine has been available for a while, but was on its last legs  as the UI only worked in Internet Explorer, and it was hard to install on any machines, and only ran on x86 hardware. I reboult the user interface in 2020 and upgraded the DSP Engine in 2021. I have now revisited the installation scripts so that it will install in one operation.
