# SqueezeBoxEQ
Revision of Inguz Plugin Web and Perl components

This projct is an inital commit of the reskin of the Inguz DSP plugin for Logitech Media Server (alias Squeezebox Server).
The original plugin had been left dormant and was reliant on Silverlight to work, and this was difficult to get going and was end of life.
The Web interface was also not friendly for change as multiple button presses were required to change values in EQ.

This change splits the javascript libraries for making calls to the Perl config Handler and those used for setting web controls. A new style-sheet has also been used.
Changes to the perl script are minor although it is due an overhaul.

Further instructions pending.
